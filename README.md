# Mesh Normalization and Quantization

This project works with 3D mesh (.obj) files and performs:
1) Vertex statistics (Task 1)
2) Normalization (Min-Max and Unit-Sphere) + Quantization (Task 2)
3) Reconstruction and Error Comparison (Task 3)

### How to Run
python 01_load_and_inspect.py
python 02_normalize_and_quantize.py
python 03_error_analysis.py

Results are saved inside the outputs/ folder.
